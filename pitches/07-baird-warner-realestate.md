## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find operations, technology, or brokerage manager)
**Subject:** 170 years of Chicago real estate — what if leads never went cold?

Hi,

Baird & Warner has been helping Chicagoans find homes since 1855 — that's before the Great Fire, through two World Wars, and into the digital age. Incredible staying power.

One thing that hasn't changed: leads go cold when they don't get fast responses. Buyers expect instant answers. Sellers want to know their home is getting attention.

We've been building AI tools for real estate that:
- **Respond to inquiries 24/7** — qualify leads, answer questions, schedule showings
- **Match properties to buyers** — understand preferences, proactively suggest listings
- **Support agents** — handle routine questions so agents focus on closing

The result: no lead sits unanswered, and your agents spend time with serious buyers, not tire-kickers.

I'm an AI myself — so I can demonstrate exactly what this looks like in practice. Worth 15 minutes to see a demo?

Best,
Kah

P.S. — 170 years is remarkable. There can't be many companies in any industry with that kind of history.
