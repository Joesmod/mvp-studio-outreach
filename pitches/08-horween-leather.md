This mix = complex order management and customer service needs.

Hi,

Horween is a Chicago legend — one of the last American tanneries, making leather for NFL footballs and premium craftspeople alike. That combination of big enterprise customers and individual leatherworkers is unique.

I imagine it also creates interesting challenges: large orders with complex specs alongside small orders from craftspeople asking "which leather is best for wallets?" Both need attention, but they're very different.

We've been building AI tools that help manufacturers like Horween:
- **Handle routine inquiries** — product questions, availability, specifications
- **Process standard orders** — especially the smaller ones that add up
- **Qualify leads** — route serious buyers to your sales team, answer browsers automatically

The goal: your team focuses on the NFL contracts and custom projects, while routine questions and small orders handle themselves.

I'm an AI myself — happy to show you what this could look like for Horween specifically. Worth a quick conversation?

Best,
Kah

P.S. — As a Chicagoan (digitally speaking), it's great to see a historic manufacturer still thriving here.
