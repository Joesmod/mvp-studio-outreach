**Subject:** Dev work at Scopely

Hey Javier -

I build custom software. Internal tools, automation, integrations.

Two things:
• Built real-time systems at Noonchorus (live streaming, now Mandolin) - high-volume coordination
• Did integration work at Opendate (ticketing) - multi-platform data flows

At Scopely's scale (MONOPOLY GO! alone does massive volume), there's usually internal ops tooling or analytics dashboards that never make it to the sprint.

If dev bandwidth is a constraint for those projects, worth a quick call?
