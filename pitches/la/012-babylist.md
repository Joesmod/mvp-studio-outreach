**Subject:** Software for Babylist

Hey Natalie —

Babylist supporting 9M families annually is impressive. Registry to full ecosystem is a big evolution.

I build custom software for commerce and marketplace companies. Two relevant things:
• Built real-time systems at Noonchorus (live streaming infrastructure)
• Worked on integrations and data pipelines at Opendate (ticketing/venue tech)

Platform expansion usually means more internal tooling needs — especially with Babylist Health and the Shop. If there's anything stuck waiting for dev bandwidth, I could help accelerate it.

Worth a 15-min call?
