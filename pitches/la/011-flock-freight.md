Hey Oren -

Shared Truckload is a smart wedge into freight. Pooling thousands of shipments with AI is no small feat.

I noticed Flock's value around operational excellence - "automate, simplify, adopt technology."

I build custom software for logistics companies. Recently helped a supply chain platform integrate 3 carrier APIs in 2 weeks, consolidating their tracking into one dashboard.

If Flock has internal tools or integrations on the backburner, worth a quick chat?
