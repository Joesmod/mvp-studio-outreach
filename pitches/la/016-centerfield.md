**Subject:** Quick question

Hey Kris -

Saw Centerfield on Inc. 5000 again. 150M shoppers through Dugout is no joke.

Question: any internal tools or automation projects stuck on the backburner?

I build custom software for growth-stage companies. Recently helped a B2B company cut their data pipeline processing by 60%.

Happy to share examples if relevant.
