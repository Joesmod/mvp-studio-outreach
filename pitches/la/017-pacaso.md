**Subject:** Software dev for Pacaso

Hey Austin -

I build custom software. Web apps, internal tools, integrations.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time systems at Noonchorus (live streaming, now Mandolin) — scheduling, coordination, high-availability
• Worked on venue integrations at Opendate — seat data, ticketing systems, partner APIs

Real estate platforms at your scale usually have internal tooling debt — owner portals, property management dashboards, booking systems, vendor integrations.

If any of that's on the backburner, worth a quick call?
