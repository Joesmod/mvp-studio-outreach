Hi [Name],

Consumer electronics with high SKU counts and multi-channel distribution creates operational complexity that generic software wasn't designed for.

Inventory allocation, channel coordination, returns processing - when you're managing thousands of SKUs across DTC, retail, and marketplace channels, the gaps in standard tools become expensive.

We build custom operations platforms. If Belkin has processes still held together by spreadsheets, worth a conversation.
