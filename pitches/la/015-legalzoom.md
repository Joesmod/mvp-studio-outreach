**Subject:** Software dev for LegalZoom

Hey Jeff -

I build custom software for companies scaling operations. Internal tools, automation, AI integration.

Relevant experience:
• Built real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) - high-stakes live event tech
• Did complex integrations at Opendate - ticketing, marketing, venue systems

At LegalZoom's scale, there's usually internal tooling or workflow automation that could use extra dev bandwidth.

If that's a constraint right now, worth a 15-min chat?
