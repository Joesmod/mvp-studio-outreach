## Email Draft

**Subject:** Custom integrations for ServiceTitan

Hey Ara -

Congrats on the IPO and continued growth.

I build custom software - integrations, internal tools, AI automation. Background in live event tech at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) and ticketing integrations at Opendate.

With 70+ integrations and enterprise customers, I'd guess there's always custom work - partner integrations, internal dashboards, automation - that could use extra dev bandwidth.

If timing's right, happy to chat about where I could help.
