**Subject:** Internal tools at Foodsmart

Hey Jason -

2.2M members across Medicaid, MA, and commercial - that's serious scale for a telenutrition platform. The SNAP integration piece is smart.

At that scale, the internal operations usually become a bottleneck. Dietitian scheduling, member engagement tracking, payer reporting - these tools often lag behind the member-facing product.

I build custom software for healthcare companies. Relevant:
• Built real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin)
• Worked on complex integrations at Opendate (venue/ticketing)

If operations tooling is slowing things down, I can help. Worth 15 minutes?
