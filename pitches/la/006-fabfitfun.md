**Subject:** Ops tools for FabFitFun

Hey Michael -

Subscription commerce at FabFitFun's scale means a lot of moving parts - inventory, fulfillment, personalization, member ops.

I build custom internal tools to streamline exactly that. Dashboards, automation, integrations.

Background:
• Built operational systems at Noonchorus (live streaming for concerts)
• Ticketing/venue integrations at Opendate

If there's a tool your team wishes they had but can't prioritize, I could build it.
