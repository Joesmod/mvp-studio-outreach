**Subject:** Software dev for Compa

Hey Charlie -

Compensation intelligence for enterprise teams - smart space, especially with pay transparency laws.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time data systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin)
• Worked on complex integrations at Opendate - ticketing and venue data across dozens of partners

If Compa has internal tools, automation, or integrations that keep getting deprioritized, I could help ship them.
