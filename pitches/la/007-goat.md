**Subject:** Internal tools for GOAT

Hey Eddy -

GOAT's authentication and fulfillment ops are impressive. That kind of scale usually means internal tooling becomes a bottleneck.

I build custom software - seller dashboards, workflow automation, integrations.

Background:
• Real-time systems at Noonchorus (live concerts)
• Operational tools at Opendate (ticketing/venues)

If there's a backlog project your team can't prioritize, I could help.
