**Subject:** Software dev for ChowNow

Hey Chris -

Love what ChowNow is doing for independent restaurants. 22k partners and $650M in saved commissions is real impact.

I build custom software - internal tools, automation, integrations. Background:
• Live event tech at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) - real-time coordination systems
• Venue integrations at Opendate - messy external data into clean internal workflows

At your scale, there's always internal tooling the product team can't prioritize - restaurant onboarding flows, ops dashboards, partner analytics. Happy to help on that front.

Worth a 15-min call?
