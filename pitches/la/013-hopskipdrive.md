**Subject:** Software help for HopSkipDrive

Hey Joanna -

I build custom software for mission-driven companies. Internal tools, automation, web apps.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (live concert streaming - lots of moving parts)
• Venue/school-type integrations at Opendate (ticketing + event ops)

Transportation platforms usually have internal tooling that ops needs but engineering deprioritizes - dispatcher dashboards, partner portals, scheduling tools.

If you have projects stuck on the backburner, I could help ship them fast.

Worth a quick call?
