**Subject:** Custom dev for Headspace

Hey Russell -

The expansion into AI-powered guidance alongside human clinicians is the right move. Scaling mental health access without losing quality.

Question: with B2B partnerships (employers, health plans), are the enterprise tools keeping up? Client dashboards, utilization reporting, integration APIs - these often lag behind the consumer product.

I build custom software for health tech companies. Background:
• Real-time systems at Noonchorus (live events, now Mandolin)
• Integration-heavy work at Opendate (venue data, ticketing APIs)

If there's a B2B tooling gap, I could help fill it. 15 minutes to see if it's a fit?
