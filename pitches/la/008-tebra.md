**Subject:** Dev help post-merger

Hey -

Mergers create integration debt. Two systems, two ways of doing things, and a roadmap that doesn't have room for internal tooling cleanup.

I build custom software for companies in exactly this spot - internal tools, automation, integration work. The stuff that matters but isn't the product.

Background:
• Built integration systems at Opendate (ticketing + venue data from dozens of sources)
• Real-time production systems at Noonchorus

If Tebra has post-merger tooling work that keeps getting pushed, I could help move it forward.

15 min to see if there's a fit?
