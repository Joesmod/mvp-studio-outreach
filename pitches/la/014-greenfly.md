**Subject:** Software dev for Greenfly

Hey Daniel -

I build custom software - web apps, internal tools, AI automation.

Greenfly's doing real-time content delivery for sports orgs - that's my wheelhouse. I built live event coordination systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) and venue integrations at Opendate.

If you have internal tools, integrations, or automation stuck on the backburner, I could help move them forward.

Worth a 15-min chat?
