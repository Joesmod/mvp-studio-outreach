**Subject:** Integration dev for System1

Hey -

You've done a bunch of acquisitions. That usually means systems that don't talk to each other and internal tooling that nobody has time to fix.

I build custom software for exactly this - integrations, internal tools, automation. The important stuff that's not the product.

Background:
• Built integration systems at Opendate - connecting venue data from dozens of APIs
• Production systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) - real-time, can't-fail infrastructure

If System1 has integration work or internal tools stuck in the backlog, I could help.

Quick chat to see if there's a fit?
