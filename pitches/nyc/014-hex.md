Hey Barry -

Hex's approach to agentic analytics is smart - making data analysis collaborative instead of siloed.

Question: with the AI/agentic push, are there tools or features getting deprioritized?

I build custom software for tech companies. Happy to share past work - have built real-time systems and complex data pipelines.
