**Subject:** Dev help for Lattice

Hey Sarah -

I build custom software for fast-moving companies. Internal tools, automation, AI features.

Two things:
• Built real-time systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) - production infrastructure for live events
• Did ticketing + marketing integrations at Opendate - lots of API and data pipeline work

If Lattice has projects stuck waiting for dev bandwidth - internal tools, integrations, customer-facing features - I could help move them.

Quick call to see if there's a fit?
