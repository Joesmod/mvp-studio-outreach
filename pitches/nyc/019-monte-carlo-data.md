**Subject:** Dev bandwidth at Monte Carlo

Hey Barr -

I build custom software for data companies. Internal tools, automation, web apps.

Two relevant things:
• Built data pipeline integrations at Opendate (venue/ticketing systems - messy data, lots of edge cases)
• Real-time production systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin)

Growth-stage companies usually have internal tooling that keeps getting deprioritized - admin dashboards, customer onboarding tools, ops automation.

If engineering bandwidth is a constraint and you have projects stuck, I could help ship something fast.

Quick call to see if I can help?
