**Subject:** Software dev for Rokt

Hey Bruce —

Saw the mParticle merger and Canal acquisition. You're building quite the ecommerce stack.

I build custom software for high-growth companies. Two relevant things:
• Built real-time event systems at Noonchorus (live streaming) — similar transaction-moment timing challenges
• Worked on venue/ticketing integrations at Opendate — dealt with enterprise data pipelines

700+ employees means a lot of internal tooling needs. If there's anything stuck on the backburner, I can help accelerate it.

Worth a 15-min chat?
