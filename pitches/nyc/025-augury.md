**Subject:** Software dev for Augury

Hey Saar -

Congrats on the Series F. $75M to accelerate industrial AI — that's serious momentum.

After a raise like that, internal tools and automation usually become bottlenecks. I build custom software for companies at this stage.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) — production-grade infrastructure
• Shipped MVP projects for B2B companies in 4-6 weeks

If dev bandwidth is a constraint on any internal projects, worth a quick chat?
