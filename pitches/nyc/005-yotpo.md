## Email

**Subject:** Internal tools at Yotpo

Hey Tomer -

I build custom software for companies. Web apps, internal tools, AI automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time systems at Noonchorus (live streaming) - high-volume data coordination
• Did platform integrations at Opendate (ticketing) - multi-partner ecosystem work

With Yotpo touching tens of thousands of brands across that many integrations (Shopify, Salesforce, Klaviyo), there's usually internal tooling that gets deprioritized.

If dev bandwidth is tight for ops tools or admin dashboards, happy to chat.
