**Subject:** Software dev for Via

Hey Daniel -

I build custom software - internal tools, integrations, automation.

Relevant background:
• Real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (live streaming tech, now Mandolin)
• Multi-system integrations at Opendate (venue ticketing + marketing platforms)

Serving 600+ cities means constant integration work with different municipal systems, legacy APIs, and compliance requirements. If your core team is stretched on that front, I can help move projects forward.

Worth a quick call?
