**Subject:** Software dev for Gynger

Hey Tim -

Gynger's approach to B2B tech payments is smart — same-day setup, AI-powered approvals. That kind of speed wins.

Question: as you scale integrations and workflows, any internal tooling needs?

I build custom software for fintech companies. Background in real-time systems at Noonchorus (live streaming infra, now Mandolin) and integrations at Opendate (ticketing + venue data).

Worth a 15-min chat?
