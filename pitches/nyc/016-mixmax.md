## Email Draft

**Subject:** Dev help for Mixmax

**Body:**

Hey Olof -

"Why not now?" - that's my kind of engineering culture. Ship fast, iterate, deliver value.

I build custom software for SaaS companies. Web apps, internal tools, AI automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (live streaming, now Mandolin)
• Recently helped a B2B platform automate their sales ops workflow, saving 10+ hours/week

If Mixmax has projects stuck on the backburner, I could help move them forward.

Worth a 15-min chat?
