**Subject:** Internal tools at Zerocater

Hey Arram -

Saw Zerocater operates across 9+ cities with complex logistics - restaurant coordination, delivery, client ordering.

That usually means internal tools and automation become bottlenecks as you scale.

I build custom software for operations-heavy companies:
• Built real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (live events, time-critical)
• Worked on multi-location data syncing at Opendate (venue ticketing)

If you've got internal projects stuck in the backlog, I could help move them.

Quick call?
