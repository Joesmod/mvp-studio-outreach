## Research Notes

- AI-powered healthcare billing platform
- Products: Cedar Pay, Cedar Cover, Cedar Support
- Kora AI voice agent for patient billing support
- NYC HQ (32 Ave of Americas)
- ~$3B+ valuation, Series D
- Focus: patient financial experience, reducing uncompensated care

## Pain Point

Scaling AI features (Kora), integrations with payers/providers, internal tooling.

**Subject:** Software dev for Cedar

Hey Florian -

I build custom software - web apps, internal tools, AI automation.

Cedar's doing interesting work on AI-powered billing (Kora looks smart). Usually that kind of product expansion means integration and internal tooling work piles up.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time systems at Noonchorus (live event tech, now Mandolin)
• Worked on complex integrations and data pipelines at Opendate

If dev bandwidth is a constraint, worth a 15-min chat?
