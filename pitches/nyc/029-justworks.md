**Subject:** Internal tools at Justworks

Hey Isaac -

Justworks makes PEO actually usable for small teams. The UX is noticeably cleaner than competitors.

Question: as you've grown, are the internal operations tools keeping pace? Support dashboards, compliance tracking, onboarding automation - these usually get deprioritized when the customer product is the focus.

I build custom software for companies. Relevant:
• Real-time coordination at Noonchorus (live events platform)
• Complex integration work at Opendate (venue data across systems)

If there's internal tooling that's creating friction, I can help move it forward. Worth a quick chat?
