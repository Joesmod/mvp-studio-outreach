**Subject:** Software for Spring Health

Hey April —

Congrats on the global expansion — 40+ countries is impressive reach.

I build custom software for health tech companies. Two things that might be relevant:
• Built real-time systems at Noonchorus (live streaming) handling coordination at scale
• Background in complex integrations and data pipelines at Opendate

Healthcare at your scale usually means integration challenges, provider tooling, and internal workflows that pile up. If you've got projects waiting for dev bandwidth, I can help move them forward.

Quick call to see if there's a fit?
