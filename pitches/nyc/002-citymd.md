**Subject:** Patient flow optimization for CityMD

Hi [Name],

100+ urgent care locations means 100+ opportunities for operational bottlenecks. Patient flow, staff allocation, real-time capacity - the complexity compounds fast.

We build custom operations platforms for multi-location healthcare. One regional clinic network reduced average wait times 25% with a purpose-built flow management system.

If CityMD has operational challenges that off-the-shelf software isn't solving, worth a quick conversation.
