**Subject:** Integration dev for DOOR

Hey David -

I build custom software for companies dealing with complex integrations. Web apps, internal tools, automation.

PropTech means messy third-party data - building systems, access controls, property managers with different setups. I've been there.

Relevant:
• Built venue integration systems at Opendate (ticketing) - dealing with dozens of POS and ticketing APIs
• Real-time coordination at Noonchorus for live events

If DOOR has integration work or internal tools that keep getting deprioritized, I could help.

Quick chat?
