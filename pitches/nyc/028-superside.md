Hey Fredrik -

Does Superside need help building internal tools or automation?

I build custom software for fast-scaling companies. Two relevant things:
• Built real-time production systems at Noonchorus (live streaming, now Mandolin)
• Worked on complex integrations and internal tools at Opendate (venue ticketing)

At your scale — global team, enterprise clients, AI workflows — there's usually internal tooling that could use dedicated dev time.

Happy to share examples if helpful.
