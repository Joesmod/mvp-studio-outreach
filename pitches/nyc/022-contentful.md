**Subject:** Internal tools at Contentful

Hey Sascha -

I build custom software - web apps, internal tools, AI automation.

Contentful is handling 180B+ API calls/month and 30% of Fortune 500. At that scale, internal tooling and custom integrations usually become the bottleneck.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) - high-throughput live event coordination
• Experience with enterprise integrations at Opendate

If there's dev work stuck on the backburner, worth a quick chat?
