## Email Draft

**Subject:** Internal tools for Noom

Hey Saeju -

Saw Noom Med launched the GLP-1 companion program. That's a big expansion.

Usually when product lines multiply, internal tools become a bottleneck. I build custom software to fix exactly that - dashboards, workflow automation, integrations.

Background: Built real-time systems at Noonchorus (live streaming), operational tools at Opendate (ticketing). Both scaled fast.

If dev bandwidth is stretched, happy to help.
