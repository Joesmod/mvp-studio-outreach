**Subject:** Integration dev for Olo

**Body:**

Hey Noah -

400+ integrations is serious. That's a lot of partner APIs to maintain and new ones to build.

I build custom software and integrations for tech platforms. Previously worked on real-time systems at Noonchorus (live streaming, now Mandolin) and venue integrations at Opendate.

If Olo needs extra dev bandwidth for integrations or internal tools, worth a quick chat?
