**Subject:** Quick question for Braze

Hey Bill -

I build custom software - internal tools, integrations, AI automation.

Two relevant data points:
• Built real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (live streaming, now Mandolin)
• Did venue/platform integrations at Opendate (ticketing)

At Braze's scale, there's usually internal ops tooling or integration work that product teams can't prioritize. Customer success dashboards, admin workflows, data pipelines.

If any of that's stuck in the backlog, worth a 15-min chat?
