## Email Draft

**Subject:** Dev bandwidth at Ramp

Hey Eric -

Ramp's product velocity is impressive. That pace usually means internal tools get deprioritized.

I build custom software - internal dashboards, integrations, automation. Things that free up your core team.

Background:
• Real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin)
• Data integrations at Opendate (ticketing/venue systems)

If there's a backlog project that needs an external builder, I could help.
