Hey Carly -

I build custom software for companies - internal tools, automation, subscriber products.

Quick background:
• Built real-time systems at Noonchorus (live streaming, now Mandolin)
• Worked on marketing + data integrations at Opendate (venue ticketing)

Media companies at your scale usually have backlogged internal tools - subscriber analytics dashboards, content workflow automation, ad ops tooling. If any of that resonates, happy to chat.
