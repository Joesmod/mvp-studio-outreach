**Subject:** Dev capacity for Narmi

Hey Nikhil -

Community banks competing with mega banks and fintechs - Narmi's mission resonates.

When you're scaling fast, dev bandwidth usually becomes the constraint. Internal tools, integrations, and automation get pushed back.

I build custom software for growing companies. Background in real-time systems (Noonchorus/Mandolin) and complex integrations (Opendate ticketing).

If there's a backlog project that needs to ship, worth a quick chat?
