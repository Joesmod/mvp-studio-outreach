## Email Draft

**Subject:** Internal tools for Attentive

Hey Amit -

I build custom software for growing tech companies - internal tools, automation, integrations.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time systems at Noonchorus (live event streaming, now Mandolin) - handling high-volume coordination
• Experience with messaging integrations and data pipelines

With 1000+ employees across multiple offices, I'd guess there's always internal tooling that could use dev attention. If something's stuck on the backlog, I could help move it forward.

Worth a quick chat?
