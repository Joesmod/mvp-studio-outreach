**Subject:** Dev for Benchling

Hey Sajith -

I build custom software. Internal tools, integrations, AI automation.

Quick background:
• Built real-time production systems at Noonchorus (live streaming, thousands concurrent)
• Did complex data integrations at Opendate - venue systems, seat maps, third-party APIs

If Benchling has internal tools or integrations that need dev bandwidth - happy to help move them forward.

Worth a quick call?
