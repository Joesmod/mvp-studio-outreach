**Subject:** Flatfile is solving a real pain

Hey David -

Used to build data import tools myself - they're always messier than anyone expects. What Flatfile's doing is smart.

I build custom software for companies. Internal tools, automation, integrations.

Two relevant things:
• Built messy data integrations at Opendate (venue systems, ticketing data - infinite edge cases)
• Real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin)

If there's internal tooling that keeps getting deprioritized - admin dashboards, customer success tools, workflow automation - I could help ship something fast.

Worth a quick call?
