**Subject:** Software dev for Reachdesk

Hey Alex -

I build custom software. Web apps, internal tools, automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) — live events, 100K+ concurrent users
• Worked on integrations at Opendate — venue data, ticketing APIs, partner connections

At your scale (180+ countries, enterprise clients), there's usually at least one internal dashboard, integration, or customer-facing tool that's been waiting for dev time.

Worth a 15-min chat to see if I can help?
