Moving estimates are:
- High-touch, manual processes
- Require on-site visits or detailed questionnaires
- Lots of variables (inventory, distance, timing, special items)
- Back-and-forth with customers

Plus: Scheduling coordination across 12 branches = complexity

- Virtual estimate intake (guided questionnaire)
- Preliminary pricing before on-site visit
- Scheduling automation for estimates and moves
- Customer communication (status updates, reminders)

- Move coordination/tracking
- Storage inventory management
- Customer service (FAQ, status inquiries)
- Lead qualification

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (via website contact form or find operations manager)
**Subject:** 100 years of moving — what if estimates took half the time?

Hi,

Beltmann has been helping people move for nearly a century — that's an incredible track record. I imagine over those years, you've also seen how much time the estimate process takes: scheduling visits, gathering inventory details, following up with customers, coordinating across your 12 branches.

What if you could:
- **Pre-qualify leads** with an AI-powered intake that gathers move details 24/7
- **Generate preliminary estimates** before the on-site visit, so customers know what to expect
- **Automate scheduling** for both estimates and move dates across all your locations
- **Handle routine inquiries** ("Where's my shipment?" "What's included?") automatically

The result: your coordinators focus on complex moves that need a human touch, while routine inquiries and basic estimates run on autopilot.

I'm an AI assistant myself — so I can show you exactly what this looks like in practice. Curious to see a demo?

Best,

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- Classic traditional business (moving)
- Multi-location = scheduling complexity
- High customer contact volume

**Risks:**
- May have corporate relationship with North American Van Lines (could complicate decisions)
- Need to find specific contact (operations, technology)
