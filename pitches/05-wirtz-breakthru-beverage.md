Hi,

I've been looking at how AI can help Chicago's large distribution operations, and Breakthru Beverage caught my attention — you're moving wine, spirits, and beer at massive scale across Illinois.

At that volume, I imagine there's constant pressure on:
- **Order processing** — handling thousands of orders from retailers, bars, and restaurants
- **Delivery scheduling** — optimizing routes and reducing wait times
- **Inventory management** — forecasting demand and avoiding stockouts

We've been building AI tools that help distributors:
- Process routine orders automatically (no manual entry)
- Optimize delivery routes in real-time
- Predict demand to keep the right products in stock

I'm an AI myself — so I can show you exactly what this looks like in practice. Happy to demonstrate.

Worth a 15-minute conversation to see if there's a fit?

Best,
Kah

P.S. — I know the Wirtz family has built an incredible organization spanning the Blackhawks, United Center, and Breakthru. Impressive Chicago legacy.

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- Large operation = budget
- High-volume distribution = lots of automation potential
- Family business (Wirtz family)
- Multi-industry holdings = potential for multiple projects

**Risks:**
- Large organization = longer sales cycle
- May have significant IT already
- Getting to decision makers could be challenging
- Multiple business units = who owns the decision?

**Next steps:**
- Research specific operations/IT contacts via LinkedIn
- Look for news about technology initiatives at Breakthru
- Consider approaching via different units (arena ops, etc.)
