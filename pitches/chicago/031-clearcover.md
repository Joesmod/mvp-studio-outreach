**Subject:** Internal tools at Clearcover

Hey Kyle -

Your 7-minute claims processing is impressive. AI doing the heavy lifting on claims decisions is exactly where insurance needs to go.

Question: as you've scaled across states, are the internal tools keeping up? Underwriting dashboards, agent workflows, compliance tracking - these often get deprioritized when the customer-facing product is the focus.

I build custom software for companies. Two relevant things:
• Built real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (live events, now Mandolin)
• Worked on venue integrations at Opendate - lots of edge cases and state-specific logic

If internal tooling is creating friction, I can help. Worth a quick chat?
