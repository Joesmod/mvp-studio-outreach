**Subject:** Software dev for OppFi

Hey Todd -

I build custom software for fintech companies. Web apps, internal tools, AI automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) for live streaming - high-throughput, mission-critical
• Worked on integrations and seat mapping at Opendate - complex data pipelines across multiple partners

If OppFi has internal tools, automation, or customer-facing features that keep getting pushed to "later" - I could help move them forward.

Worth a 15-min call?
