**Subject:** Internal tools for PowerReviews

Hey Ziya -

I build custom software for SaaS companies. Internal tools, automation, AI integrations.

Two things that might be relevant:
• Built live event infrastructure at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) - real-time data processing at scale
• Did ticketing/marketing integrations at Opendate - lots of third-party API work

With 650+ brand partners, I'd guess there's internal tooling (reporting, onboarding automation, data pipelines) that could use dev help.

If bandwidth is tight, worth a quick chat?
