## Email Draft

**Subject:** Internal tools for ShipBob

Hey Dhruv -

I build custom software for fast-growing companies - internal tools, automation, integrations.

Relevant background:
• Built real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (live streaming, now Mandolin)
• Worked on venue/ticketing integrations at Opendate - lots of data pipeline work

With 60+ fulfillment centers and thousands of merchants, I'd guess internal tooling and operational dashboards are always on the backlog. If there's something stuck, I could help.

Quick call to see if I can be useful?
