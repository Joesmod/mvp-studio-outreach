**Subject:** Software for deal tracking at Much Shelist

Hey [Name] -

I build custom software for professional services firms.

Noticed Much Shelist handles complex real estate transactions across buyers, sellers, investors, and lenders. That usually means deal tracking and client coordination gets messy fast.

Two things that might be relevant:
• Built deal management systems for similar transaction-heavy firms
• Worked on real-time coordination at Noonchorus (live events - now Mandolin)

If there's a process at the firm that's still manual or stuck in spreadsheets, I could probably help.

Worth a 15-min call?
