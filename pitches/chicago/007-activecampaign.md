**Subject:** Internal tooling at ActiveCampaign

Hey Jason -

I build custom software - internal tools, integrations, automation.

Two things that might be relevant:
• Built systems for Noonchorus (now Mandolin) handling real-time event coordination
• Did integrations work at Opendate connecting multiple external platforms

With 800+ people across continents, there's usually internal tooling that falls behind product priorities. Admin dashboards, ops automation, data pipelines.

If any of those are on the backburner, happy to chat about taking them off your plate.
