**Subject:** Dev help for internal tools

Hey -

I build custom software for trading and fintech companies. Web apps, internal dashboards, automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time systems at Noonchorus (live concert streaming - sub-second latency coordination)
• Background in data pipeline integrations at Opendate

Trading firms often have internal tools that ops teams need but engineering deprioritizes - admin dashboards, reporting tools, workflow automation.

If that sounds familiar and you have projects stuck in the backlog, I could help move them forward.

Worth a quick call?
