**Subject:** Internal tools for Cameo

Hey Steven -

I build custom software - internal tools, automation, integrations.

Background that might be relevant:
• Built live event production systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) - coordinating talent, timing, and delivery at scale
• Worked on multi-party integrations at Opendate (ticketing + marketing for venues)

With 50k+ talent and enterprise clients, there's probably internal tooling your product team never gets to - talent ops dashboards, fulfillment tracking, B2B client tools. That's my lane.

Worth a quick chat?
