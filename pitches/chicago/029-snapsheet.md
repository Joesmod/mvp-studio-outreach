Hey Brad -

I build custom software. Web apps, internal tools, AI automation.

Two relevant things:
• Worked on real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) — live events with 100K+ concurrent users
• Built integration pipelines for venue ticketing at Opendate — seat maps, third-party data ingestion

At your scale (170+ insurers, millions of claims), I'm guessing there's at least one internal tool or integration that's been stuck on the backburner.

Worth a 15-min call to see if I can help?
