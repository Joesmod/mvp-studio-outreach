## Email Draft

**Subject:** Dev help for Avant

Hey Matt -

I build custom software for fintech companies. Internal tools, automation, integrations.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time event systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) - high-throughput, mission-critical
• Experience with data pipelines and operational dashboards

Lending at scale means a lot of internal tooling pressure. If Avant has projects on the backburner, I could help move them.

Worth a 15-min call?
