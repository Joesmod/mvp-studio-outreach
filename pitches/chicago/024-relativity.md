## Research Notes

- Legal data software with AI (RelativityOne, aiR products)
- aiR for Review, aiR for Privilege, aiR for Case Strategy
- Generative AI built into platform
- FedRAMP authorized
- Chicago HQ, major legal tech player
- Acquired Heretik for contract review

## Pain Point

Scaling AI-driven legal tools, new integrations, internal tooling for complex data workflows.

**Subject:** Internal tools at Relativity

Hey -

I build custom software - web apps, internal tools, AI automation.

Saw Relativity is pushing hard on generative AI (aiR products). Usually that kind of expansion means internal tooling and integrations become bottlenecks.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time data systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin)
• Experience with complex data pipelines and integrations at Opendate

If dev bandwidth is a constraint, worth a quick chat?
