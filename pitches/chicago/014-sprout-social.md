**Subject:** Internal tools for Sprout

Hey Ryan -

Congrats on taking the helm at Sprout. Big shoes, exciting roadmap.

Quick pitch: I build custom software for companies at scale - internal tools, integrations, AI automation. The stuff that's important but not core product.

Relevant background:
• Built live event tech at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) - real-time coordination systems
• Worked on venue integrations at Opendate - dealing with messy third-party data

Public companies often have internal tooling debt that's hard to prioritize against product roadmap. If that resonates, happy to chat.
