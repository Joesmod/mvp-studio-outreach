## Company Research

K1x provides AI-powered automation for Schedule K-1s, 1099s, W-2s, and 990s. Built for accounting firms, funds, family offices, and fund admins processing tax forms in volume. Claims 50% time savings from K-1 automation. Patented technology for private market tax data operations.

## Why Them

- Processing complex financial data at scale = likely need internal tools
- B2B SaaS selling to accounting firms = operational complexity
- Growing fintech = potential backlog of dev projects

**Subject:** Dev help for K1x

**Body:**

Hey Michael -

K1x's approach to K-1 automation is smart. Digitizing private market tax data is a gnarly problem.

Question: do you have any internal tools or integrations stuck on the backburner?

I build custom software for growing fintechs. Recently helped a B2B platform cut their data processing workflow from 4 hours to 20 minutes.

If dev bandwidth is a constraint, worth a quick chat?
