**Subject:** Internal tools at Tempus

Hey Eric -

I build custom software for companies. Web apps, internal tools, AI automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time data systems at Noonchorus (live concert streaming, now Mandolin)
• Worked on integrations at Opendate - venue/ticketing data pipelines

At Tempus's scale, there's usually internal tooling that engineering never has bandwidth for. Data dashboards, workflow automation, admin tools that sit on the backburner.

If that's a constraint, I could help move something forward fast.

Worth a quick call?
