**Subject:** Dev help for Hireology

Hey Adam -

I build custom software for B2B companies - web apps, internal tools, integrations.

Quick background:
• Built ticketing and venue integration systems at Opendate - lots of multi-location data syncing
• Worked on real-time production systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin)

If Hireology has any projects that keep getting deprioritized - custom integrations, internal dashboards, automation - I could take them off your plate.

15 minutes to see if there's a fit?
