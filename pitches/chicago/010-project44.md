**Subject:** Dev help for internal tools

Hey Jett -

I build custom software for companies. Internal tools, automation, integrations.

Two things that might be relevant:
• Built real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) - live event tech where timing is everything
• Worked on venue/ticketing integrations at Opendate - connecting messy external systems into clean internal workflows

At your scale, there's always stuff the core product team can't prioritize - internal dashboards, customer onboarding tools, data pipelines. That's what I help with.

Worth a 15-min call?
