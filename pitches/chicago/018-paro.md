## Email Draft

**Subject:** Software dev for Paro

**Body:**

Hey Anita -

Two-sided marketplaces are hard. The matching, the ops tools, the dashboards - it compounds fast.

I build custom software for B2B platforms. Recently helped a marketplace company automate their talent vetting workflow, cutting review time by 60%.

If Paro has any internal tools or automation stuck in the backlog, I could help move them forward.
