## Email Draft

**Subject:** Custom software for Uptake

Hey Kayne -

I build custom internal tools and AI automation for growing tech companies.

Two things that may be relevant:
• Built real-time data systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) - coordinating live event streams
• Recently helped a logistics company cut reporting time by 40% with custom dashboards

As Uptake scales across industries, internal tooling usually becomes a bottleneck. If you've got projects stuck on the backburner, I could help move them forward quickly.

Worth a 15-min chat?
