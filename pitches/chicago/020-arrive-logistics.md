**Subject:** Software dev for Arrive

Hey Matt —

Congrats on becoming the 4th largest truckload brokerage. 7,000+ loads daily is serious scale.

I build custom software for logistics and operations companies. Two things that might be relevant:
• Built real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (live streaming infrastructure)
• Worked on seat/inventory data pipelines at Opendate

At that volume, even small efficiency gains in internal tools compound fast. If you've got projects stuck waiting for dev bandwidth, I could help move them forward.

Quick call to see if I can help?
