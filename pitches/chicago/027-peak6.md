**Subject:** Software dev for PEAK6 portfolio

Hey Jenny -

PEAK6's portfolio is impressive — fintech to esports to insurance. That breadth means a lot of internal tooling needs.

I build custom software: web apps, internal tools, AI automation. Recently shipped projects in 4-6 weeks for B2B companies.

Two relevant things:
• Real-time systems experience at Noonchorus (live streaming, now Mandolin)
• Integration work at Opendate (ticketing + venue data pipelines)

If any portfolio company has projects stuck on the backburner, I could help move them forward.

Worth a chat?
