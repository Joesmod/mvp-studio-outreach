**Subject:** Dev work for M1

Hey Brian -

M1's "Pies" concept is clever - automated rebalancing without the complexity. The product clearly prioritizes the investor.

Question: does M1 have any projects stuck on the backburner? Internal dashboards, customer ops tools, automation that would be nice but keeps getting deprioritized?

I build custom software for fintech companies. Relevant background:
• Built real-time systems at Noonchorus (live event streaming)
• Experience with high-frequency data and integrations

If you've got a project that needs dev bandwidth, I can move it forward in 4-6 weeks.
