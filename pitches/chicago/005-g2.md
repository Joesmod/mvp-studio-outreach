## Email Draft

**Subject:** Software help for G2

Hey Godard -

G2 is the first place I check before buying any tool. The review quality is unmatched.

Question: are you building out any internal tools or automation right now?

I build custom software - web apps, integrations, AI automation. Recently helped a B2B platform cut manual data processing by 60% with automated workflows.

If dev bandwidth is a constraint on internal projects, happy to share past work.
