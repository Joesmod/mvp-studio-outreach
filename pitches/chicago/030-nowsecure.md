**Subject:** Internal tools help

Hey Alan -

I build custom software for B2B companies. Internal tools, integrations, AI automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time production systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) — high-availability, zero-downtime
• Worked on complex integrations at Opendate — venue data, third-party APIs, compliance

Security companies often have internal tooling debt — dashboards, reporting, customer-facing portals that need attention but aren't core product.

If that sounds familiar, worth a quick call?
