Hey Mark -

I build custom software for companies. Internal tools, automation, integrations.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time systems for Noonchorus (live concert streaming, now Mandolin) - high-volume coordination under pressure
• Worked on venue integrations at Opendate (ticketing) - similar multi-partner inventory challenges

At your scale (400+ cities, 11k locations), I'm guessing there are internal ops tools or integrations that never quite got built.

If dev bandwidth is a constraint for those backburner projects, worth a quick chat?
