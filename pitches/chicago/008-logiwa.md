**Subject:** Internal tools at Logiwa

Hey Erhan -

I build custom software for companies. Saw Logiwa is scaling fast with fulfillment networks and 3PLs.

Two things that might be relevant:
• Built real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) - high-volume, time-sensitive operations
• Recently helped a logistics company cut manual data reconciliation by 60%

If you've got internal tools or integrations stuck on the backburner while the team focuses on core product, I could help move them forward.

Worth a 15-min chat?
