**Subject:** Dev help for Braviant

Hey Brent -

I build custom software for fintech companies. Web apps, internal tools, AI automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) - handled live event coordination for thousands of concurrent users
• Background in data integrations from Opendate (ticketing/venue systems)

If Braviant has any tools stuck on the backburner - fraud dashboards, ops automation, customer-facing features - I could help move them forward quickly.

Worth a 15-min chat?
