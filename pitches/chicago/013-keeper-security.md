**Subject:** Dev help for Keeper

Hey Darren -

I build custom software for growing companies. Web apps, internal tools, AI automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) - live streaming coordination for concerts
• Experience with integrations and production systems that can't go down

Keeper's scaling fast. That usually means internal tools and automation become bottlenecks - things that aren't core product but still eat engineering time.

If you've got projects stuck on the backburner, I could help move them forward.

Worth a 15-min chat?
