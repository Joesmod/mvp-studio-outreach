**Subject:** Automation for Nextpoint

Hey Rakesh -

Saw Nextpoint is automating eDiscovery for law firms - impressive that you've been at this since 2001.

Question: are there internal ops or customer-facing features that keep getting deprioritized?

I build custom software for SaaS companies. Recently helped a B2B platform cut their data processing time by 60%.

Happy to share examples if helpful.
