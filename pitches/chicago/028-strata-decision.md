**Subject:** Software dev for Strata

Hey Dan -

Strata's expansion from healthcare into financial institutions and higher ed is smart — same financial planning DNA, new markets.

That kind of growth usually means internal tooling and automation become bottlenecks.

I build custom software for B2B SaaS companies. Background includes real-time systems and complex integrations.

If there are any projects stuck on the backburner, I could help move them forward in 4-6 weeks.

Worth a quick chat?
