- AI features for property analytics and automated proposal generation
- "AL" AI assistant for listings

Scaling AI features and integrations while maintaining CRE-specific workflows.

**Subject:** Software dev for Buildout

Hey -

I build custom software for companies. Web apps, internal tools, AI automation.

Two things that may be relevant:
• Built real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) for live events
• Worked on venue integrations and seat data pipelines at Opendate

If Buildout has any internal tools or integrations on the backburner, I could help move them forward.

Worth a 15-min chat?
