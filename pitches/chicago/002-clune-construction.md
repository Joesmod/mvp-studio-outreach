**Subject:** Subcontractor coordination at Clune

Hi [Name],

Managing subcontractors across data centers and healthcare builds is a coordination nightmare. Standard construction software handles the basics, but the real complexity - compliance tracking, real-time site updates, resource conflicts - usually falls through the cracks.

We build custom operations platforms for construction companies. One client cut their project coordination overhead by 40% with a purpose-built tool.

If Clune has any processes that are still manual or stuck in spreadsheets, worth a quick call to explore.
