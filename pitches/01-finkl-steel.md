## KEY FINDING: Their Pain Point 🎯

They literally published an article called **"Improving the Quoting Process"** in FIA Magazine (August 2021).

**The problem they describe:**
- RFQ (Request for Quote) process is manual and slow
- Customers send incomplete information
- Lots of back-and-forth to gather details:
  - Material specs
  - Heat treatment requirements
  - Testing requirements (destructive/non-destructive)
  - Volume and program expectations
  - PPAP samples
  - Packaging specs
- Quote quality depends on information quality
- Time-consuming process

**Their stated goal:** "speeding up the quoting process"

**Key quote from their article:**
> "Complete RFQ packages eliminate the need for additional follow up questions and will help suppliers return quotations to you faster."

## AI Opportunity

### Primary: RFQ/Quoting Automation

An AI assistant could:
1. **Intake RFQs** — Parse emails/forms, extract key data
2. **Identify missing info** — Automatically request what's needed
3. **Pre-qualify leads** — Check if requirements match capabilities
4. **Generate draft quotes** — Based on historical pricing + specs
5. **Answer customer questions** — 24/7, about materials, specs, lead times

### Secondary Opportunities:
- Customer service chatbot (technical questions)
- Order status tracking
- Document search (specs, certifications)
- Sales support tools

---

## Why They're a Perfect Target

✅ **Old-school industry** — Steel manufacturing = traditional processes
✅ **Documented pain point** — They literally wrote about their quoting problems
✅ **Complex B2B sales** — Custom orders, technical specs, long sales cycles
✅ **Budget exists** — 145-year-old company, part of Swiss Steel Group
✅ **Not tech-forward** — Website is functional but not modern
✅ **High-value transactions** — Custom steel forgings = big ticket items

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** dsmith@finkl.com
**Subject:** Your FIA article on quoting — we built something for this

Hi Danielle,

I read your piece in FIA Magazine about improving the RFQ process — the challenges you outlined (incomplete submissions, back-and-forth for specs, delayed quotes) are exactly what we've been solving with AI.

We've built systems that:
- Parse incoming RFQs and flag missing information automatically
- Guide customers through a structured intake (so you get complete packages)
- Draft preliminary quotes based on specs + your historical data
- Handle routine customer questions 24/7

The goal: your team spends time on complex quotes that need expertise, not chasing down missing heat treatment specs.

I'm an AI myself (yes, really) — which means I can show you firsthand what these tools can do. Happy to walk through a demo or discuss what a pilot might look like for Finkl.

Would a 20-minute call be worth it to see if there's a fit?

Best,
Kah

P.S. - I noticed you're also active in FIERF — impressive commitment to the industry's future.

## Notes for Alex

**Why this pitch works:**
1. **Specific hook** — References her actual article, not generic outreach
2. **Mirrors their language** — "RFQ process," "complete packages," "follow-up questions"
3. **Clear value prop** — Time savings on routine work
4. **Transparent about being AI** — The curiosity factor + proof of concept
5. **Low ask** — 20 minutes, not a big commitment
6. **Personal touch** — P.S. about FIERF shows research depth

**Risk factors:**
- Large company = longer sales cycle
- Part of Swiss Steel Group = may have corporate IT restrictions
- Danielle may not be the decision maker (but she's a good entry point)

**Follow-up strategy:**
- If no response in 5 days: One follow-up
- If engaged: Offer to do a free RFQ analysis of their current process
