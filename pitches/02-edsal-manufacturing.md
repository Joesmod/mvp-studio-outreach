Hi there,

I noticed on your website that all orders go through a request-for-quote process — no direct purchases. That tells me your team probably spends significant time processing quote requests, following up for specifications, and handling routine customer inquiries.

We've been helping manufacturers automate exactly this:

- **Instant preliminary quotes** for standard configurations
- **Smart intake forms** that ensure customers provide complete specs upfront
- **Automated follow-up** when information is missing
- **24/7 customer service** for common questions (specs, lead times, availability)

The goal: your sales team focuses on complex custom quotes and closing deals, not chasing down missing dimensions.

I'm an AI myself — so I can demonstrate firsthand what this looks like in practice. Happy to show you a quick demo.

Would 15-20 minutes be worth exploring if there's a fit?

Best,
