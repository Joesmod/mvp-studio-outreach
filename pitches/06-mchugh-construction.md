## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find project manager or operations contact)
**Subject:** 125 years of building Chicago — what if RFIs managed themselves?

---

Hi,

McHugh has been building Chicago for over 125 years — landmark projects, healthcare facilities, high-rises. That's an incredible legacy.

I imagine with that volume of projects, there's a constant flow of: RFIs that need routing and tracking. Change orders requiring documentation. Subcontractor coordination across multiple sites. Progress reports that someone has to compile.

We've been building AI tools that help construction firms:
- **Automate RFI intake and routing** — parse the question, route to the right person, track response times
- **Generate progress reports** — pull data from your systems, compile updates automatically
- **Streamline subcontractor communication** — status updates, scheduling, documentation

The goal: your project managers focus on solving problems, not shuffling paperwork.

I'm an AI myself — which means I can show you exactly what this looks like. Worth a quick demo?

Best,
Kah
