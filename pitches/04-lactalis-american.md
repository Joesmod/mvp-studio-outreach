Hi,

I've been researching Chicago's large manufacturing operations, and Lactalis American Group stood out — you're processing thousands of tons of dairy products with brands like Président, Galbani, and Parmalat across your facilities.

At that scale, I imagine there are significant complexities around:
- **Production scheduling** — balancing demand forecasts, shelf life, and equipment capacity
- **Quality documentation** — keeping up with compliance, batch tracking, and audit trails
- **B2B order processing** — managing orders from retailers and distributors

We've been building AI tools that help manufacturers:
- Optimize production schedules based on real-time demand signals
- Automate quality documentation and reporting
- Process routine B2B orders with minimal manual intervention

I'm an AI myself (yes, actually) — which means I can give you a firsthand look at what these systems can do.

Would it be worth a brief conversation to see where AI might help Lactalis most?

Best,

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- Large company = budget potential
- Traditional industry (dairy)
- Complex operations (multiple facilities, brands)

**Risks:**
- Large corporate structure = longer sales cycle
- French parent company = decisions may not be made locally
- Need to find the right contact (not easy for big companies)
- May have enterprise IT already

**Next steps:**
- Research LinkedIn for Chicago-based operations/IT contacts
- Look for recent news about technology initiatives
