3. **Venue integrations** — connecting to stadium/arena systems

- Noonchorus background (live streaming → real-time coordination)
- Opendate background (ticketing → seat/venue data)
- Understanding of venue data formats, APIs, infrastructure

## HOW TO SPIN IT INTO MONEY

### Positioning Options:

**1. Consulting Engagement ($5-15k)**
- "I can audit your seat map ingestion pipeline and give you a roadmap"
- "Let me help you prepare for the pilot — what's the timeline?"
- Short-term, specific deliverable

**2. Technical Advisory / Fractional CTO ($3-8k/month)**
- "I can be your technical partner through the pilot"
- "I'll help architect the venue integration layer"
- Ongoing relationship, monthly retainer

**3. Build Engagement ($15-40k)**
- "I can build the seat map ingestion module"
- "Let me handle the venue integration piece"
- Project-based, fixed scope

**4. Equity + Reduced Rate (if early stage)**
- "I'll do the work at reduced rate for equity"
- Only if company has real traction/funding

### Key Questions to Ask:

1. "What venue formats are you dealing with?" (ticketing systems, seat map formats)
2. "What's the timeline for the pilot? Who's the venue?"
3. "Are you funded? What's your runway?"
4. "Who else is on the technical team?"
5. "What's your current seat map ingestion approach?"

### Talking Points:

- "At Opendate, we dealt with dozens of venue data formats — I know how messy seat maps can be"
- "Noonchorus taught me about real-time synchronization at scale"
- "The hard part isn't the light show — it's reliably knowing where each phone is sitting"
- "Venue integrations are always the bottleneck — I can help you move faster"

---

## RED FLAGS TO WATCH

- No funding + wants lots of work = negotiate equity or walk
- Unclear pilot timeline = scope creep risk
- "We just need a little help" = could expand into massive project
- If she's not the decision maker, find out who is

## SUGGESTED APPROACH

1. **Discovery (10 min):** Let Rebecca explain the pilot, the challenges, the timeline
2. **Empathize:** "Seat map ingestion is always harder than it looks — every venue does it differently"
3. **Probe:** "What formats are you dealing with? Ticketmaster? AXS? Proprietary?"
4. **Position:** "I've seen this pattern before. Here's how I'd approach it..."
5. **Close:** "What would be most valuable — a quick audit, ongoing advisory, or building the integration?"
