# Cold Email Rules

## What NOT to Do
1. **No emails over ~200 words** - Less is more. No life stories.
2. **No fancy words** - Remove ALL buzzwords. Read out loud. Sound human.
3. **No vague emails** - Be specific. Use real examples and numbers.
4. **No emails without an ask** - One clear, specific thing you want them to do.
5. **No spam** - Max 1-2 follow-ups. No lies about experience.
6. **No fake personalization** - Don't say "been a fan for years" if not true.

## Email Format (3 parts only)
1. **Who you are** - One sentence max
2. **Why you're reaching out** - What you want to help with
3. **Why they should care** - Specific proof (numbers, examples, past work)

## Good Email Examples

**Example 1 (Spiegel email):**
> "Hey, my name's Niraj Pant. I understand your time is valuable. I'll only write three bullet points.
> - Programming since 8th grade
> - Most experience in Java/Obj-C/Android/iOS  
> - Want to intern for Snapchat this summer
> How?"

**Example 2:**
> "Hey Ryan - [product] is so good. Used it last week for [reason] and was impressed.
> 
> Question: how are you doing on copywriting at the moment? Asking because I write for startups. Don't want to blast you with a wall of text so re: work background, that's mostly on my site.
> 
> Happy to share past work if helpful."

**Example 3:**
> "Hey Kevin - heard about Your Company from a friend. I'm emailing because I saw you just raised a seed round and I'd like to help you build the product.
> 
> Two things that may be relevant:
> • Worked at That Company, helped build Successful Feature (big driver of ARR)
> • Built Personal Project, currently has 100,000 active users
> 
> I think I could help you build out [Product] quickly. Worth a chat?"

## Process
1. Find companies on funding news, directories, etc.
2. Find CEO or hiring manager on LinkedIn
3. Get email (firstname@company.com or use tools)
4. Send email following rules above
5. Follow up ONCE after 3-5 days
6. **Email 30+ companies** - volume matters, luck is part of it

## Key Insight
You can email ANY company - even without job postings, even if they say specific requirements. Startups make exceptions.
